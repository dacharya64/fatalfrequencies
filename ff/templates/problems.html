Makes sense, and I agree that this is lower priority. A simpler version of this that meets similar needs is letting the GM filter/sort problems and edges by type, so for instance, having all physical injuries as their own category, and the GM can find one to give if giving an arbitrary physical (athletics/fighting/etc. challenge).
